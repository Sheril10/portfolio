    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Iâ€™m passionate about building inclusive tech solutions and making education accessible for all. Check out my projects, CV, and get in touch!</p>
    <p>I am a dedicated and driven Computer Science student with a strong passion for Software Engineering 
    and Project Management and Community Development. As a Graphics Post Designer Co-Lead 
    in couple of student societies, I have honed my skills in visual storytelling and event planning,
    including my role in organizing and reporting for Gen Fest 2024.
    My expertise spans graphic design, persuasive communication, team lead and
    strategic project management. I am always open to collaborations, mentorship, 
    and discussions that inspire growth, innovation, and social impact.With a 
    commitment to empowering marginalized voices, my work addresses issues such 
    as gender bias in STEM fields and advocates for equity in education and technology. 
    My leadership extends to community-based projects in Lahore, where I focus on impactful 
    and budget-conscious initiatives to promote accessible education. I have also conducted
    in-depth research on digital wellness, proposing actionable solutions to my semester 
    exchange university, University of Wisconsin- Stout in United States of America. 
    I am also engaged in the Digital Cultural Passport project, documenting diverse perspectives 
    through visual narratives and blog posts. As a Christian woman and the eldest daughter 
    in my family, I bring values of integrity, empathy, and resilience to both my personal 
    and professional endeavors.
